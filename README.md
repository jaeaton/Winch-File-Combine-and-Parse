# Winch-File-Combine-and-Parse
UNOLS ECWP log file combiner and cast parser

This program combines small log files into larger log files. For processing, it has the ability to estimate casts and then log the line parameters for Maximum Tension and Maximum Payout.

Program supports logs from:
1. ECWP MASH Winches
2. SIO Traction Winch
3. UNOLS Wire String Equipment

Planned future support for:

~~1. UNOLS Wire String logs~~

2. Hawboldt winch logs
3. WinchDAC logs

It may be useful to add a plot showing payout and tension.

Eventually this will be rolled into ECWP Winch Data Viewer
